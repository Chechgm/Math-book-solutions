2 These kind of measures correspond to discrete probabilities.
8 There is a certain theorem, that this exercise is impossible if A is closed under intersections
10 We say here that continuity "from above" is false in general for measures, but it IS true for probability measures!
11 Inclusion-exclusion formula!
