\subsection{1A Review: Riemann integral}

2 some easy practice with the definitions
3 this should show that riemann integrals don't like functions that are too duscontinuous, to be continued later
8 do note this limit can exist without the function being riemann integrable
13 every monotone function is riemann integrable. Can monotone functions be very discontinuous?
14 probably the most important property of this chapter. Interchanging limit and integral is crucial to analysis. The fact the riemann integrals only allow s this in uniform case, is extremely limiting and THE big reason why we want to look for a different integral
