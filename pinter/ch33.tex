\begin{exercise}{A Finding radical extensions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find radical extensions of $\Q$ containing the following complex numbers:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(\sqrt{5}-\sqrt[5]{2})/(\sqrt[4]{3}+\sqrt[3]{4})$.
        \item $\sqrt{(1-\sqrt[9]{2})/\sqrt[3]{1-\sqrt{5}}}$.
        \item $\sqrt[5]{(\sqrt{3}-2i)^3/(i-\sqrt{11}}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Show that the following polynomials in $\Q[x]$ are not solvable by radicals:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $2x^5-5x^4+5$.
        \item $x^5-4x^2+2$.
        \item $x^5-4x^4+2x+2$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Show that $a(x)=x^5-10x^4+40x^3-80x^2+79x-30$ is solvable by radicals over $\Q$, and give its root field. [Hint: Compute $(x-2)^5-(x-2)$].
    \item Show that $ax^8+bx^6+cx^4+dx^2+e$ is solvable by radicals over any field. [Hint: Let $y=x^2$; use the fact that every fourth degree polynomial is solvable by radicals].
    \item Explain why parts 3 and 4 do not contradict the principal finding of this chapter: that polynomial equations of degree greater than or equal to 5 do not have general solution by radicals.

\begin{exercise}{B Solvable groups}
Let $G$ be a group. The symbol $H\triangleleft G$ is commonly used as an abbreviation of ``$H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$''. A normal series of $G$ is a finite sequence $H_0,H_1,\dots,H_n$ of subgroups of $G$ such that $\{e\}=H_0\triangleleft H_1\triangleleft\dots\triangleleft H_n=G$. Such a series is called a solvable series if each quotient group $\quot{H_{i+1}}{H_i}$ is abelian. $G$ is called a solvable group if it has a solvable series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why every abelian subgroup is, trivially, a solvable group.
    \item Let $G$ be a solvable group. with a solvable series $H_0,\dots,H_n$. Let $K$ be a subgroup of $G$. Show that $J_0=K\cap H_0,\dots,J_n=K\cap H_n$ is a normal series of $K$.
    \item Use the remark immediately preceding Theorem 2 to prove that $J_0,\dots,J_n$ is a solvable series of $K$.
     \item Use parts 2 and 3 to prove: every subgroup of a solvable group is solvable.
     \item Verify that $\{e\}\subseteq\{e,\beta,\delta\}\subseteq S_3$ is a solvable series for $S_3$. Conclude that $S_3$, and all of its subgroups, are solvable.
     \item In $S_4$, let $A_4$ be the group of all the even permutations, and let $B=\{e,(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}$. Show that $\{e\}\subseteq B\subseteq A_4\subseteq S_4$ is a solvable series for $S_4$. Conclude that $S_4$ and all its subgroups are solvable.
