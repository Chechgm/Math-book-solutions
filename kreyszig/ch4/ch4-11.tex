\begin{exercise}{1}

\begin{proof}
The coefficients are $h = (b-a)/n$, the interval of integration divided in $n$ equal segments.
The nodes are $t_n^\ast = a + h(k - 1/2)$, the midpoints of these segments.
\end{proof} 

\begin{exercise}{2}
fill
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
The coefficients are as in the rectangular rule, with the difference that the first and last coefficients are also multiplied by $1/2$.
The nodes are the endpoints of those segments.
To see how we can arrive to those choices, consider the approximation of a function by a piecewise linear function:
