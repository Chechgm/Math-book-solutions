\section{Strong and weak convergence}

1 Notice that convergence in C[a,b] is uniform, while weak convergence implies pointswise
2
3 Some easy properties
4 How does this relate to Fatous lemma in $L^1$
5
6
7 these three exercises show how weak convergence relates to closures and how they are still useful there
8
9
10 Some properties on weak cauchy and weak completeness. It is now interesting to see if weak convergence has an underlying structure, this is true, it is called the weak topology. This is a very interesting topology that nevertheless doesn't come from a metric space, and this is one of the main reasons topology is interesting in analysis
