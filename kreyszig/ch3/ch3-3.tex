10 Two very important theorems related to the orthogonal complement and double complement. Used all the time!

\begin{exercise}{1}
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $M \subseteq H$ a convex subset, and $(x_n)$ a sequence in $M$ such that $\norm{x_n} \to d$, where $d = \inf_{x \in M} \norm{x}$.
Show that $(x_n)$ converges in $H$.
Give an illustrative example in $\R^2$ or $\R^3$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
We will follow a strategy similar to Theorem 3.3-1.
To do that, we will prove $(x_n)$ is Cauchy, and then it will follow by the completeness of $H$, that $(x_n)$ converges in $H$.
Let $\norm{x_n} = d_n$.
We have that $\norm{x_n + x_m} = 2\norm{1/2(x_n + x_m)} \geq 2d$, because $x_n/2 + x_m/2$ is in $M$ due to its convexity.
Now by the parallelogram equality, we have that
\begin{align*}
    \norm{x_n - x_m} 
    =& -\norm{x_n + x_m}^2 + 2(\norm{x_n} + \norm{x_m})\\
    \leq& -(2d)^2 + 2(d_n + d_m) \to 0,
\end{align*}
where the convergence to 0 follows from the fact that $d_n,d_m \to d$.
Thus $(x_n)$ is Cauchy and by the completeness of $H$ it must converge to a point in $H$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{2}
Show that the subset $M=\set{y=(y_i): \sum y_i=1)}$ of complex space $\C^n$ (see 3.1-4) is complete and convex.
Find the vector of minimum norm in $M$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
(Complete)
Let $(x^n)$ be a sequence (of sequences) in $M$, so that for each sequence, $\sum_i x^n_i=1$.
Assume $x^n\to x$, so that for every $\epsilon>0$, we can find an $n\in\N$ such that $\norm{x^n-x}_1<\epsilon$.
We have
\begin{align*}
    \absoluteValue{1-\sum_i x_i}
    =& \absoluteValue{\sum_i x^n_i - \sum_i x_i}\\
    =& \absoluteValue{\sum_i x^n_i - x_i}\\
    \leq& \sum_i\absoluteValue{x^n_i - x_i}
    <\epsilon.
\end{align*}
That is, $x\in M$
Theorem 1.4-6 states that a closed subset of a complete space is complete.
Since $\C^n$ is complete, and $M$ is closed, then $M$ is complete.

(Convex)
For $x,y\in M$ and $a\in[0,1]$, we have
\begin{align*}
    \sum_i (ax_i+(1-a)y_i)
    =& \sum_i ax_i + \sum_i (1-a)y_i\\
    =& a\sum_i x_i + (1-a)\sum_i y_i\\
    =& a + (1-a) = 1,
\end{align*}
so that $ax+(1-a)y\in M$.

(Vector of minimum norm)
The norm of a vector $x$ in $\C^n$ is $\sum_i x_i\bar{x}_i$.
The vector that minimises such norm is $x_i=1/n$ for all $i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the vector space $X$ of all real-valued continuous functions on $[-1,1]$ is the direct sum of of the set of all even continuous functions and the set of all odd functions on $[-1,1]$.
    \item Give examples of representations of $\R^3$ as a direct sum (i) of a subspace and its orthogonal complement, (ii) of any complementary pair of subspaces.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item even: $f(-x) = f(x)$, odd: $f(-x) = -f(x)$.
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{5}
Let $X=\R^2$.
find $M^\perp$ if $M$ is
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\set{x}$, where $x = (x_1,x_2) \neq 0$,
    \item a linearly independent set $\set{x_1,x_2}\subseteq X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We can use the Gram-Schmidt process to find the vector orthogonal to $x$.
    In general, take any $y = (y_1,y_2)\in\R^2$.
    Then the vector
    \begin{align*}
        x' = y -\text{proj}_x(y) = y - \frac{\brackets{x,y}}{\brackets{y,y}}y
    \end{align*}
    is orthogonal to $x$.
    So that $M^\perp = \vecspan{(x)}$.
    \item Since the set is linearly independent, its span constitutes a basis of $\R^2$. 
    Thus, the only vector orthogonal to both of them simultaneously is 0.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{6}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $Y = \set{x \mid x = (x_n) \in l^2, x_{2n}=0, n\in\N}$ is a closed subspace of $l^2$ and find $Y^\perp$.
    \item What is $Y^\perp$ if $y = \vecspan{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n} \subseteq l^2$, where $e_j = (\delta_{jk})$
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To see that $Y$ is closed, consider any convergent sequence in $Y$, $(x_n^k) \to (x_n)$. 
    We have that for all $k$, $x_{2n}^k = 0$ for all $n\in\N$.
    Since convergence in $l^2$ implies convergence of each one of the elements of the sequence, it must be the case that $x_{2n} = 0$ for all $n\in\N$.
    Thus $(x_n) \in Y$ and $Y$ is closed.
    
    We have that $Y^\perp = \set{x \mid x = (x_n) \in l^2, x_{2n+1}=0, n\in\N}$.
    We can see this from two perspectives.
    The first is that $l^2 = Y \oplus Y^\perp$.
    The second is that any element from $Y^\perp$ (and only from $Y^\perp$) has zero inner product with $Y$.
    \item As in the previous numeral, $Y^\perp$ is $\overline{\vecspan{(e_{n+1}, e_{n+2},\dots)}}$ given that the inner product between $Y$ and $Y^\perp$ is 0.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{7}
Let $A$ and $B$ with $A \subseteq B$ be nonempty subsets of an inner product space $X$.
Show that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A \subseteq A^{\perp \perp}$.
    \item $B^\perp \subseteq A^\perp$.
    \item $A^{\perp \perp \perp} = A^\perp$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $a \in A$, we have that $\brackets{a,a'} = 0$ for all $a'\in A^\perp$.
    We also have that $\brackets{a', a''} = 0$ for all $a'' \in A^{\perp \perp}$, that is, $a \in A^{\perp \perp}$ so that $A \subseteq A^{\perp \perp}$.
    \item Let $b' \in B^\perp$.
    We have that $\brackets{b', b} = 0$ for all $b \in B$, but this implies $\brackets{b', a} = 0$ for all $a \in A$, because $A \subseteq B$;
    that is, $b' \in A^\perp$, so that $B^\perp \subseteq A^\perp$.
    \item To prove this, we will use a combination of the previous results.
    
    ($\subseteq$)
    We proved that $A \subseteq A^{\perp \perp}$.
    Using this in conjunction with the second result, we have that $(A^{\perp \perp})^\perp \subseteq A^\perp$.

    ($\supseteq$)
    We proved that $A \subseteq A^{\perp \perp}$, replacing $A$ for $A^\perp$, we have that $A^\perp \subseteq (A^\perp)^{\perp \perp}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
